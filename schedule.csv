These concepts apply broadly to data engineering, and isn't just for PySpark developers. Many data engineers don't have the time, knowledge, or patience to build automated tests for their Spark pipelines. This talk will start with organizing your code, then walk through the test-driven development process and apply it to data engineering tasks like building verifiably high-quality DataFrame transformations. If there's time, the talk will then demonstrate how to translate the TDDE concepts to building AWS Glue pipelines with PySpark.

2040,10:00 to 10:40 ,Usability testing in open source software,Iverson Center for Faith (ICF) A,Jim Hall,"Your program might be easy for **you** to use, but can someone else use it just as easily? If we want people to use open source software, it has to be easy to learn and easy to use, or people will not use it. In this session, we'll learn about *usability testing* - what it is, why it's important, and how to do it. You don't need a ""usability lab"" to do usability testing - you don't even need to be in the same room. You can learn a lot just by watching five people use the software to do a set of tasks. We'll walk through all the steps to do your own usability test and how to understand the results so you can make your software even better.

While this particular vulnerability may be patched satisfactorily by now, our current technology landscape means these incidents will continue to happen over and over again. We may not be able to predict exactly when they'll occur but we can take steps to be more prepared to handle them when they do show up. Join us for an open discussion about how Log4Shell-type events impact technology teams logistically and strategically. Our panel will feature consultants with experience in development, project delivery, product strategy and architecture. We've seen these events play out in companies across the state and want to share what we've learned.
We'll cover questions like
- How can developers move quickly without moving recklessly?
- How should the response differ based on the company's size and product?
- How can product/project delivery teams protect customers and support developers?
- How do solution architects handle the feeling that you should re-evaluate everything?
- Is it a good thing for your CEO to know the name of your low-level logging framework?

If you’ve tried, or have been interested in leveraging the strengths of real-time data processing - maybe for machine learning, IoT, anomaly detection or data analysis - but you’ve been held back: I’ve been there, and it’s frustrating. And that’s why this talk is for you.  
That being said, this talk is also for you if you ARE experienced with stream processing but you want an easy (and if I say so myself, pretty fun) way to add some of the newest, bleeding edge features to your toolbelt. 
This session will be about getting started with Flink SQL. Apache Flink’s high level SQL language has the familiarity of the SQL you know and love (or at least, know…), but with some powerful new functionality, and of course, the benefit of being able to be used with Flink and PyFlink.  
More specifically, this will be a pragmatic entry into creating data pipelines with Flink SQL, as well as a sneak peek into some of its newest and most interesting features.
","Caito is a Software-Engineer-turned-Developer-Advocate. She represents the US region for Ververica, creators of Apache Flink (a stream processing engine).

Public education is doing next to nothing to meet this need. We're trying to change that. 
Our presentation demonstrates the effectiveness benefits and effectiveness of bringing Open Source software into K-12 education through school based Linux clubs. The award-winning Aspen Academy Penguin Corps uses Linux and Open Source software to rejuvenate old computers, which are then used by students who need them. This closed our school's Digital Divide. 
We'll explain how our school solved its COVID-19 induced digital equity problems through the use of Open Source software and recycled computers, ultimately providing over 300 computers for students for less than $7,000. From there, we'll talk about how we've used open source to provide computers for our classrooms, for a pilot 1:1 program, and how we'll use Open Source to create exciting new learning opportunities in the next school year.

7010,3:00 to 3:40 ,Decentralized Emerging Architecture-Agile Integration,Anderson Student Center (ASC) B,Poonam Garg,"The role of APIs in the enterprise continues to grow. We see rapid API adoption across many new use cases, causing engineers to think about APIs in new ways. In the enterprise, our engineering demands are complex. We have high standards for security, discoverability, and governance. There’s a high demand for creating more microservices, requiring us to have a strategy to address issues related to API consistency and composition. Modern software development methodologies like continuous development and agile help shorten the lead times to develop and release software. But that can result in more fragmentation and overall complexity. Too many microservices, not well organized.
This talk will introduce a Decentralized Emerging Architecture Approach (or a cell-based architecture) that can help improve your design patterns for building microservices in an organized manner. The cell-based architecture is based on our experience across hundreds of internal API projects. We propose this architecture to help address the challenges microservice API developers will face at scale. This forward-looking approach also helps enhance engineering agility.

It is a technology that radically changes how we identify and solve technical problems. In a world where virtually all applications are born distributed — it seems to be something that you ought to know in more detail.
This talk will provide a pragmatic overview of distributed tracing by clearly articulating its motivation, problems it solves, the challenges, and what technologies you should use to ensure a vendor-agnostic implementation.
It will discuss things like white-box and black-box instrumentation, the pros and cons of each approach, and why most developers prefer one versus the other.

It’s easily achievable through open source tooling. 
In this talk we will focus on five critical security controls that will be integrated as part of the CI/CD pipeline by leveraging some excellent open source tools, including: Bandit or SEMGrep for static application security (SAST), Gitleaks to detect hard-coded or insufficiently secured secrets & dependency checks (SCA), KICS for infrastructure as code (IaC) and OWASP’s ZAP for API and dynamic application security (DAST), in addition to custom controls to ensure proper enforcement of MFA via Github Security. These controls will provide a foundational framework for securing your applications from the first line of code, that will make it possible to continuously iterate and evolve your security maturity all the way through advanced layers of security that comes with time, as well as increased experience with your deployments, stacks, and security posture. 
Code examples & demos will be showcased as part of this session.
